 *
 * Represents a single block species that can exist inside a World.
 *
 * A BlockType is effectively a *template* â€“ every block placed in the world only
 * stores its numeric `id`.  All further behaviour (appearance, physics,
 * interaction rules, sounds, fire behaviour, etc.) is resolved through the
 * associated BlockType instance that shares that id.
 *
 * Usage pattern
 * -------------
 * Each BlockType is usually created once at game-start and then registered in
 * the global `World.blockTypes` table (see `world.ts`).  The fluent *builder*
 * helpers (`withTextureâ€¦`, `withLiquid`, `withMiningCat`, â€¦) allow you to
 * configure a new instance in a single expression:
 *
 * ```ts
 * world.registerBlock(
 *   new BlockType(42, "Birch Log", "birch")
 *     .withTextureTop(5)
 *     .withTextureBottom(6)
 *     .withTexture(4)           // remaining faces
 *     .withFireHealth(300)
 *     .withMiningCat("Axe")
 * );
 * ```
 *
 * Extending behaviour
 * -------------------
 * If the builder helpers are not sufficient you can subclass BlockType.  Keep
 * in mind that the engine *instantiates* BlockType *once*.  Overriding methods
 * such as `playPlaceSound` or supplying a custom `burnHandler` is usually
 * enough â€“ full subclassing is rarely required.
 *
 * Foot-guns to watch out for ðŸš§
 * ---------------------------
 * â€¢ **Colour conversion** â€“ `withColours` converts from ABGR (little-endian) to
 *   RGBA.  Supplying a normal 0xRRGGBBAA literal will therefore lead to swapped
 *   channels.
 * â€¢ **Invisible blocks also become see-through** â€“ `withInvisible(true)` sets
 *   *both* `invisible` *and* `seeThrough`, which is often what you want but can
 *   be surprising when you intend to collide with an invisible barrier.
 * â€¢ **Fire behaviour** â€“ setting `fireHealth` or `fireDamage` has no effect
 *   unless you also ensure the block can actually *burn* (i.e. provide an
 *   appropriate `burnHandler`).  Conversely, forgetting to adjust
 *   `fireSpreadToChance` may turn your custom wood into a fire-proof material.
 * â€¢ **Audio can be undefined** â€“ `playPlaceSound` / `playMineSound` will do
 *   nothing silently when `world.game.audio` is not initialised, so do not rely
 *   on the return value for game logic.
 *
 * Thread-safety / Mutability
 * --------------------------
 * BlockType instances are intentionally **mutable at start-up** (via the builder
 * helpers) but should be treated as **read-only once the world is running**.
 * Mutating shared instances at runtime will affect *all* blocks of that id.
