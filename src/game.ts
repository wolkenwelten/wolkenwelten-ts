 * Game – Abstract root of all game sessions (server *and* client)
 * "One loop to rule them all"
 *
 * # Purpose
 * • Encapsulates world state, timing and common managers that are shared
 *   by both the browser-side `ClientGame` and Node-side `ServerGame`.
 * • Provides an *update-loop* that attempts to catch up with real time
 *   (~60 Hz) without blocking for longer than ≈16 ticks.
 * • Boots a fresh world via `World` + a specific `WorldGenHandler`.
 * • Houses global registries (currently only `blocks`) that are required
 *   by content loading helpers.
 *
 * # How to extend
 * 1. Create a derived class (see `src/client/clientGame.ts` or
 *    `src/server/serverGame.ts`).
 * 2. Call `super(config)` *first* in your constructor so that common
 *    managers are initialised correctly.
 * 3. Overwrite / add managers as needed (audio, network, render …).
 * 4. When overriding `init()` or `update()` ALWAYS call `await super.init()`
 *    / `super.update()` or you will desync ticks or miss world generation.
 * 5. Set the convenience flags `this.isClient` / `this.isServer` in your
 *    subclass – *they are only hints*, but several systems rely on them.
 * 6. If you schedule your own loops (for example the server does via
 *    `setInterval`), remember to flip `this.running = true` or the base
 *    class will silently early-return in `update()`.
 *
 * # Potential footguns 🧨
 * • `ready` flag – `update()` & `gc()` NOP until worldgen finished.
 *   Forgetting to await/observe `init()` leads to apparent freezes.
 * • `ticks` is mutated inside the tight loop; never rely on it to equal
 *   *number of calls* to `update()`.
 * • Long-running synchronous work in `world.update()` can still block
 *   the event loop because it is executed repeatedly until we caught
 *   up with real time. Heavy AI or path-finding should be spread out.
 * • `registerContent()` is invoked from constructor; content code must
 *   not rely on overriden fields that are set *after* `super()`.
 * • Garbage collection (`gc()`) is naïve – it runs on a separate
 *   `setInterval` and touches world chunks directly; be mindful of race
 *   conditions if you integrate workers or atlas rebuilds.
 *
 * # Quick reference
 * • update() – step world until caught up with real-time.
 * • gc()     – thin wrapper that delegates to `world.gc()`.
 * • millis() – wall-clock milliseconds since game start.
