# Design Notes

A battle royale ARPG where players mow through monsters trying to find the Mask of Ascension which feeds on the souls of mighty warriors, granting immense power and the ability to become a god, changing the shape and rules of the world for the next round.

## Start
Players start without any equipment at a beach, where they first have to search for material to build their initial equipment with.

## Death / Persistence
Permadeath, once you die or log out that's it.

## Skills
While fighting players automatically improve their passives, like Strength or Swordsmanship. When these have improved enough a player gets a level up, granting one new active skill. This active skill may require certain other actives/passives allowing for specialization without having to choose a class up front.

## Equipment
Equipment needs to be crafted and always has sockets. These can be filled with Gems/Enchantments which can be added/removed at will.

## Loot
Monsters don't drop equipment, instead dropping Gems/Enchantments as well as Rings/Amulets.

## Mask of Ascension
This unique item may be dropped by some high-level monsters, when a player collects it it is immediatly equipped and can't be taken off while the player is alive. It immediatly grants pretty big buffs and unlocks a special skill tree. It does force the player to feed on the souls of other players, if the player hasn't killed another player for a while the mask will kill the wearer, waiting for a more suitable candidate. The wearer should also become much bigger and announce its presence with Sound, when putting on the mask there should also be like a lightning strike or something, warning other players of a new Ascender. The final active skill should be Ascension.

## Souls
Only players who have reached level 5 and up can feed the Mask, with the level determining how much points the Ascender gets.

## Ascension
During ascension the entire Island gets destroyed, the new God may now modify WorldGen parameters and even modify the World a bit in a sort of creative mode, during this phase players may only spectate. After 30 minutes a new game begins.
