## Tech Stack

You are using the following libraries:
- Vite

- gl-matrix
- ws (only on the server)


## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:
- src/ (all code is in this folder)
  - game.ts (central game loop)
  - world/ (world generation and management)
  - render/ (rendering system)
  - network.ts (shared networking system)
  - client/ (client code)
  - server/ (server code)
  - ui/ (user interface)
  - utils/ (utility functions)
  - content/ (content files - blocks, items, etc.)


## Code Style

Always use tabs for indentation.

Prefer arrow functions over function declarations, and prefer modern JavaScript features and a more functional approach.

Try not to overcomplicate things. Things should be so simple that they are obviously correct.
